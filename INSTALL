Building and Installing firmly.0cpm
===================================

You can build firmly.0cpm for any of the target
architectures included.  If you intend to port
to another target, please fork off your own git
repository, work on it until stable, and then
inform us.  We will be happy to re-integrate
your work.

If you intend to build a predefined target, please
read the helping instructions for that target to
learn how to upload the firmware to your phone.
It may not always be a matter of toggling a few
switches; serious hardware tinkering is involved
on some platforms.  On 0cpm.org you can find a
list of people inclined to help you with this work
on your phones.


To build the firmware, please run from the main
directory of the software

	make menuconfig

The first thing you should select is the target
which is basically make and model of your phone.
After that, you may have to choose a driver for
devices like network device chips, if you are
working on a device that changes its hardware
without changing its serial numbers.  This may
imply opening the case and looking at the numbers
on the chips (best done in broad daylight).


Good luck,
