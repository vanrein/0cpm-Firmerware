# Target configuration
#
# Targets are platforms on which one or more drivers can be
# configured to support various chips.  Order alphabetically
# by the manufacturer's name, then the model.
#
# Targets are selected by make and model.  Detailed selection
# of specific models (and, possibly, chips to drive) are made
# in submenus loaded from the target's own directory.

	  Depending on the model, AVM Fritz!Box can use any of a variety
	  of telephony chips.  The firmware will build a program that
	  can be incorporated into Freetz (see http://freetz.org/ for
	  details).

	help
	  This is a platform intended to run on the same platform as
	  used for building.  It is built on a raw socket, so it does
	  not require IPv6 support in the kernel.  It will obtain its
	  own network leases, so it should be tested for non-interference
	  if any other software is run on the same platform.

	  Once built, run the command src/target/rawsock/firmly0cpm.bin
	  on your current platform.  It will configure itself automatically.

	  TODO: sound devices?  keyboard?  display?

	  TODO: Demo entry. Not implemented yet.

config TARGET_LINUX_TUNTEST
	bool "Linux tunnel device"
	help
	  Test and demonstration target intended for development.

	  This creates a tunnel interface behind which the firmly.0cpm
	  firmware is working.  You can route/bridge/filter/simulate
	  the surrounding network in any way you like.

	  Once built, run the command src/target/tuntest/firmly0cpm.bin
	  on your current platform.  It will configure itself automatically.

	  TODO: sound devices?  keyboard?  display?

config TARGET_SIEMENS_GIGASET
	depends on TODO_IMPLEMENT_FIRST
	bool "Siemens Gigaset xnnnIP"
	help
	  The Siemens Gigaset platform has DECT/SIP phones with numbers
	  like C470IP or A580IP.  Important in this is the "IP" postfix.
	  There has been a short-lived clone from Target, the DIP450.

	  The platforms contain LGPL-licensed software so they permit
	  uploading new firmware from their web interface.

	  Once built, upload src/target/gigaset/firmly0cpm.bin to a
	  webserver and set the firmware location in your phone to the
	  proper URL to migrate to the new platform.

	  TODO: Demo entry. Not implemented yet.

config TARGET_SMC_WSP100_DSP200
	depends on TODO_IMPLEMENT_FIRST
	bool "SMC WSP100, WSKP100, DSP200"
	help
	  This covers the wireless models WSP100 and WSKP100, as well
	  as the table model DSP200.  The WSKP100 is a special version
	  that runs Skype, not SIP.  The space in these devices varies.

	  This DSP200 seems to resist configuration with any common SIP
	  telephony service.  You can revive the phone by compiling the
	  firmly.0cpm platform for it.

	  Once built, install by ...TODO...

	  TODO: Demo entry. Not implemented yet.
