config DEVEL
	bool "Show development build options"
	default n
	select FUNCTION_DEVEL_NETCONSOLE
	help
	  Aside from production builds, there are various intermediate
	  settings that are helpful while reverse engineering, testing
	  and debugging.  This option shows those additional builds.

	  A few examples of added facilities: very basic programs that
	  basic I/O (hook contact, LED, that sort of thing) without
	  assuming a network driver; network driver testing; and of
	  course debugging output to a platform's console interface.

	  Select this option if you are developing on the 0cpm firmerware.

config UNIMPLEMENTED
	bool "Include incomplete build options"
	depends on DEVEL
	default n
	help
	  This option selects platforms and options whose development
	  has not yet been completed.

	  Select this option while developing on such incomplete code.
	  It is possible to checkin such code as long as the Kconfig
	  options include "depends on UNIMPLEMENTED"

config PLATFORM_PREFIX
	string "Toolchain prefix directory"
	default ""

config PLATFORM_BIN_PATH
	string "Path to toolchain binaries"
	default "$PLATFORM_PREFIX/bin"

config PLATFORM_LIB_PATH
	string "Path to toolchain libraries"
	default "$PLATFORM_PREFIX/include"

config PLATFORM_INCLUDE_PATH
	string "Path to toolchain include files"
	default "$PLATFORM_PREFIX/include"

config NET_6BED4_SERVER
	string "6bed4 server IPv4 address"
	help
	  Specify the IPv4 address of the remote tunnel endpoint
	  that will unpack 6bed4 packages.  This is basically
	  IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration over an UDP-tunnel.

	  Details about 6bed4 can be found on:
	  http://devel.0cpm.org/6bed4/
	  This page should also help you to an IP-number; first,
	  experimental values but after RFC-acceptance there should
	  be an IANA-registered anycast address.

	  Work is underway for making this globally available on
	  an anycast-address.  Until that has been setup, there is
	  a need to specify an IPv4 address explicitly.
