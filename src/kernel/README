src/kernel
==========

This directory contains generic kernel code, written in pure C.

Kernel components provide basic functions such as control over LEDs or
buttons of the telephone device, but also timers and sound control.
The part in the kernel directory is the generic top-half of these
drivers, while the src/drive/ directory holds the corresponding,
device-specific bottom-half.

The task of the kernel source files together with macro definitions
in include files is to provide a programmer-friendly level of access
to hardware devices.  This includes resource control and handling of
resource contention -- for example, if a device lacks certain keys
or buttons, the kernel may try to replace it with a menu entry.  And
if a phone has no dedicated line buttons, a flash button or a short
hangup is accepted as a flash command, to switch between lines.

Where resources are shared, this is either done by scrolling through
them, or by assigning priorities to the claims on resources.  For
instance, if a call comes in, then its display requests take
precedence over information shown for the current call, and certainly
over a background clock.  Such priorities help to determine what is
shown at each time, and how resource struggles are resolved.
