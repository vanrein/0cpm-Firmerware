Introduction to the license conflict
------------------------------------

Before starting a project in which you use the 0cpm firmerware
on TI's C55x architecture, please understand that there is a
licensing conflict between TI's compiler licenses and the GPLv3
under which this software resides.

The GPL enforces distribution of source code as well as a complete
toolchain with which to build binaries; the TI license on the other
hand, forbids distribution of their tool chain alongside source code.
Solutions exist, but need extra attention in an early phase of
your project.


Diverting the problem
---------------------

It is difficult, but not impossible to avoid getting into trouble
with either or both licenses.  We first summerise them, and than
detail the options further down.

1. Do not release your modified code to anyone
2. Use unaltered binaries from the 0cpm project
3. Get your changes accepted in the 0cpm project
4. Get the 0cpm crew to port to your device
5. Use another chip family

We are not really happy about placing ourselves as central as the
following options do; but the fact is that we are the only party
who is not strictly held to the GPL (being the original authors)
so we can sometimes provide a pragmatic way around the GPL -- which
we are willing to do, inasfar as the openness of the firmware does
not suffer from it.


>>> ad 1. Do not release

	As an end user, you have total freedom to modify the
	code that runs on your phone.  We apologise for the
	inconvenience of having to download the toolchain from
	TI's website instead of finding it alongside the
	0cpm firmerware.
	As soon as you start start passing around (for instance,
	selling) your modified code the GPL applies; you are
	then in violation of either the GPL or the TI license
	unless you follow any of the following strategies.
	We are really sorry for the inconvenience, and will
	work with TI in an attempt to resolve it.

>>> ad 2. Unaltered binaries

	You could make the choice to use unaltered binaries
	that you can download from our website.  This could
	imply that you would have to clone a hardware
	platform.  Please inform yourself of the possible
	copyright infringements that you are risking before
	you do this.  We reverse engineered phones, which is
	not an offense as we are not copying them, but you
	might run into problems if you did.  Read (ad 2) for
	a way out.

>>> ad 3. Submit changes

	We will be happy to take contributions to the 0cpm
	firmwerware, as longs as they always lead to building
	code, without ever crossing the separation between top
	and bottom.  To enforce this, patches to top and bottom
	must be submitted separately, and each should build
	independently.  As soon as your patches have been
	processed, you would be able to acquire unaltered
	binaries and proceed as under (ad 1) but probably
	without the copyright infringement risk.  If you
	submit a good patch right away, you should not
	expect us to charge you for it, but we may need a
	few weeks before we can deliver your binary.

>>> ad 4. 0cpm ports to your hardware

	We will be happy to consider your request to port to
	any device that you designed.  Please understand that
	this is not a free service; we are trying to be as
	flexible as possible but we will need to reserve the
	time to dedicate to your product.

>>> ad 5. Other chips

	Your last bet could be to select another target platform
	than the TIC55x; specifically, one with a milder license
	for the toolchain.  The easiest would be a target platform
	that is already supported by an open source toolchain such
	as gcc or llvm.

(And yes, there is a fifth option that would be quite unpractical...
you could produce an open source toolchain for the TIC55x platform
yourself and use that for your product.)


Why we release under GPL
------------------------

We have made a deliberate choice to release our code under GPLv3 and
not under a BSD-style license.  When we started this project, the
market was full of VoIP phones that ran mediocre firmware.  Given
the effort to write such firmware, it is not a surprise that not
every whim of any user could be taken into account, but in practice
there has been no progress at all in the SIP market, because all
parties are waiting for (most) others to take the first step.

This situation is a direct result of developers in different
companies, working independently to build the same kind of software.
This uneconomical duplication of work can be resolved by sharing the
firmware, but that will only work if the rules for sharing are the
same for everyone.  This is why we set forth to create a firmware
that could serve as a basis for developers in any company, anywhere.

We also wanted to avoid the return of the same situation in the
future; by choosing the GPLv3, we ensured that future versions of
the shared 0cpm firmerware would stay open and free.  Furthermore,
the same license ensures absolute freedom for end users to replace,
update and modify the firmware.  Effectively, this will mean that
not only the manufacturers, but knowledgeable users can join the
collaborative effort to finally make SIP do what it has always been
supposed to do -- instead of sticking to a bare minimum of simulated
analog telephony.

Please understand that open source licenses are at least as serious as
commercial licenses.  Active users who believe in the aforementioned
views are known to exercise their rights to obtain source code and
access to their devices, as specified in the GPL.  If no settlement is
possible out of court, cases are being trialed, at a staggering success
rate.  Please do not understand this as a threat to undermine you or
your product, but merely to cooperate under clear and fair guidelines
of sharing.  The same rules apply to your competitors!  Manufacturers,
distributors and resellers who ship products with the 0cpm firmerware
or derivatives are all required to act in accordance with GPLv3.


A request to Texas Instruments
------------------------------

We really enjoyed developing for the TIC55x platform based on the
TI toolchain.  We are impressed by the excellent documentation that
accompanies both the tools and the target platform, and have great
respect for the accomplishments of these DSP chips.

What we don't quite understand, is that the license accompanying the
toolchain forbids the redistribution of the tools alongside source code
or code that could be compiled to other platforms than those marketed
by TI.  It does not seem very practical to distribute a compiler or
assembler without source code to pass through it  ;-)

We expect that the inability for manufacturers to live up to the GPL
without us as an intermediary might put them off, and drive some of
them to VoIP solutions by other chip manufacturers.  We do not believe
that the mere legality of the toolchain should have such a powerful
impact.

For that reason, we ask TI to consider making an exemption for the
0cpm firmerware and its derivatives, by granting permission to
redistribute the complete toolchain alongside the source code of
the 0cpm firmerware and its derivatives.  We suspect that TI will
want to include a clause that no user has the freedom to use the
toolchain to target non-TI targets.  Since this is not a limitation
to the user's ability to exercise the freedom brought to the
0cpm firmerware by the GPL, we do not expect this to be challenged.


As soon as TI permits this redistribution of their TIC55x toolkit,
we will update or remove this file from the software distribution,
and the cautioning note in src/target/Kconfig.platform
