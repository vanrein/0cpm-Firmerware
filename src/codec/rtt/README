Realtime Text support
=====================

This is an implementation of RFC 4103, "RTP Payload for Text Conversation".  Note
that 2 errata exist to this specification.  The 0cpm Firmerware implements both
the text/t.140 and the text/red MIME-types.  It is currently limited to ASCII
transmissions plus a few special control characters.

Realtime Text or RTT is an RTP profile that exchanges text as soon as it is typed.
Aside from being a great asset for people with speach or hearing impairments, it is
also a good way to automatically attend to users.  Think of menus shown on your
display, instead of slowly read out by an IVR.  Or both.  You'll steer your way
through annnoying menus at a much faster pace!

This implementation was made specifically for the 0cpm Firmerware.  It exhibits a
call rtt_send_keys () that buffers a few keystrokes for a limited amount of
time, and ships them off at the specified intervals.  The other way around, a call
to rtt_recv_keys () is made to display one or more new keystrokes.  The
error detection/correction incorporated into RTT is implemented in this module,
so the application can assume a fairly reliable keypress exchange interface.

To the user, RTT will show itself as an application named "text".  It will popup
as soon as RTT is sent to the phone, in response to it being offered as part of
the SDP negotiation.  If the remote side supports reception of RTT, then this
application will also be enabled to the user, who may then pull it up manually.
The end user will hardly notice that RTT is being used; to him, it will simply
be useful to have a texting facility in parallel to speech, and a bit special
that the interaction is live.  The automated popup when RTT is received by the
phone calls for the user's attention at just the right moments.


Try it on a desktop
-------------------

The RTT functions described here can be tested separately on a desktop system.
This simplifies development and may also be a starting point for cool games,
adventures and general inetd wrapping schemes for communication with an
automated attended of various kinds.  In doing so, please remember that the
software resides under GPLv3, like the rest of the 0cpm Firmerware.

To build it, use the specially supplied Makefile and the wrapper functions in
desktop.c -- but please note that this was made for testing purposes, and not
for portability.  Your best chances are on Linux.

To build, run::

	make -f Makefile.desktop

To test, run a command like this on each side::

	./rtt_desktop_test 2001:db8:123::45 1212 2001:db8:99::6 1313

The parameters are:

* ``2001:db8:123::45`` and ``1212`` are the local address and port to bind to.

* ``2001:db8:99::6`` and ``1313`` are the remote address and port to connect to.

If you wanted to use IPv4 you would prefix the address with ``::`` and get
away with it -- but you might have trouble routing through NAT.  The tester
opens a hole in customary local firewalls, including NAT, but the translation
of the address may make it impossible to bootstrap the connection.  It is time
that we came to the realisation that peer-to-peer communication, of which this
clearly is an example, requires the use of IPv6 to do it well.  If you need
a quick IPv6 tunnel, you can use the 6bed4 mechanism, described on
http://devel.0cpm.org/6bed4/


Test with SIP using SIPP
------------------------

Some tests warrant a simple SIP client, for example compliance testing.  This
can be achieved using SIPP, a tool that can send and receive scripted SIP
messages.  Upon reception, it can also run commands.

Use the uac.sipp or the uas-passive.sipp script.  These will send the RTP
coordinates to a named pipe (./rtp-setip-pipe) that is created automatically
and then listened to by the ./user-display.sh script.  As soon as an RTP
setup is constructed by SIPP, it will send it to the pipe, and the script
will start the RTT desktop test tool with the RTP parameters.

The commands to run such tests are::

	sipp -i [2001:db8:130::deaf] -sf uas-passive.sipp
	sipp [2001:db8:130::deaf]:5060 -i [2001:db8:987::d00f] -sf uac.sipp -m 1

It is even possible to run both client and server on the same host; there
would also be two instances of ./user-display.sh running that each start
one of the sides of the RTP session.

This setup is really simple.  It does not register or authenticate, it won't
handle exceptions, it will not tear down the connection, it will not even
stop the RTT user session when SIP signals BYE.  Much more may be causing
trouble.  This is not an end user application, but just a demo to help with
RTT codec compliancy tests.


Have fun!
