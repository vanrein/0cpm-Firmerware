Codec selection for 0cpm Firmerware
===================================

The codecs in this tree have been defined with a number of goals in mind:

* No patent-encumbered codecs: patents constipate progress
* Support for encryption through ZRTP
* Support for various applications in common use:

  - G.711 for direct exchanges with ISDN
  - G.726 for direct exchanges with DECT
  - G.722 for direct exchanges with wideband VoIP and CAT-iq
  - Speex for its wide range and excellent quality/bitrate ratio

* Enhancement of facilities:

  - RTT helps with speech and hearing impairments; and can speedup IVRs for the rest of us
  - Ogg/RTP can play radio stations from multicast sources
  - L16 can play PCM and replace computer sound devices


Codecs that are large are made optional:

* Ogg decoding (Internet radio support) could be done by the multicasting node
* Speex encoder/decoder which consumes about 100 kB of code size
