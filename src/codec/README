Codec selection for 0cpm Firmerware
===================================

The codecs in this tree have been defined with a number of goals in mind:

* No patent-encumbered codecs: patents constipate progress
* Support for encryption through ZRTP
* Support for various applications in common use:

  - G.711 for direct exchanges with ISDN
  - G.726 for direct exchanges with DECT
  - G.722 for direct exchanges with wideband VoIP and CAT-iq
  - Speex for its wide range and excellent quality/bitrate ratio

* Enhancement of facilities:

  - RTT helps with speech and hearing impairments; and can speedup IVRs for the rest of us
  - Ogg/RTP can play radio stations from multicast sources
  - L16 can play PCM and replace computer sound devices

Codecs that are large or contraversial are optional:

* Ogg decoding is computationally heavy, and could be done by a central node
* Speex encoder/decoder consumes about 100 kB of code size
* L16 as it might not be to everyone's taste to have an open sound player next to them
* T.38 over UDP is the best FoIP method; it locally integrates with TFTP over LLC1

Note that RTT is hardly contraversial -- it is about 1 kB of code, and can add great
benefit to all users -- not just the deaf or speech impaired.  Making it available
by default not only creates a World were handicaps cause less isolation, but it also
sends a strong signal to PBX developers to start texting their IVR menus so we can
get on wading through lists of options.  The only case where RTT is not to be built
into the 0cpm Firmerware is actually when there is no display to use.
